A Multimodal AI Framework for Detecting Online Misinformation Using Text and Visual Cues

Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of social media and online content platforms has led to a significant increase in the spread of misinformation in the form of false news, misleading text, and manipulated visual content. Existing automated detection systems often focus on either textual analysis or visual analysis independently, which limits their effectiveness when misinformation is presented using a combination of text and images. Moreover, single-modal systems struggle to identify sophisticated misinformation that appears credible in one modality but deceptive in another.

There is a need for an intelligent and reliable system that can analyze both textual and visual information simultaneously to accurately detect online misinformation. Such a system should be capable of extracting meaningful patterns from text and identifying visual manipulations, and then integrating these insights to make a more informed and robust decision

Project Solution Description:
The project proposes a multimodal AI-based solution that detects online misinformation by analyzing both text and images. NLP techniques are used to evaluate textual credibility, while computer vision models identify manipulated visual content. The results from both analyses are combined to improve misinformation detection accuracy compared to single-modal systems.
